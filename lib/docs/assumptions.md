# Implementation Assumptions

This document outlines the assumptions made during the implementation of state management, Pusher real-time events, and API services in the Wawu Mobile application.

## API Structure

1. **Base URL**: We've assumed a RESTful API structure with a base URL in the format `https://api.example.com/v1`. This can be configured via environment variables.

2. **Endpoints**: Based on the entity models and screens in the app, we've created placeholder endpoints following RESTful conventions:
   - `/users` - User-related endpoints
   - `/messages` - Messaging-related endpoints
   - `/notifications` - Notification-related endpoints
   - `/gigs` - Gig/job-related endpoints
   - `/blog/posts` - Blog post-related endpoints
   - `/products` - E-commerce product-related endpoints

3. **Authentication**: We've assumed JWT-based authentication with tokens provided in authorization headers. The API service is designed to add these headers automatically when available.

4. **Error Handling**: We've assumed the API returns error responses in a consistent format with at least a status code and message.

## Pusher Implementation

1. **App Structure**: We've assumed a Pusher Channels application with public and private channels.

2. **Channel Naming**: We've followed a structured channel naming convention:
   - `conversation-{id}` - For direct messages between users
   - `user-notifications-{id}` - For user-specific notifications
   - `gigs` - For general gig/job updates
   - `blog` - For blog post updates
   - `products` - For product updates

3. **Event Naming**: We've established consistent event naming patterns:
   - `new-{entity}` - When a new entity is created
   - `{entity}-updated` - When an entity is updated
   - `{entity}-deleted` - When an entity is deleted
   - `{entity}-read` - When an entity is marked as read (for messages, notifications)

4. **Authentication**: We've assumed Pusher channel authentication is handled by the backend for private channels.

## Data Models

1. **ID Format**: We've assumed string-based IDs for all entities for flexibility.

2. **Timestamps**: We've assumed ISO 8601 formatted date strings for all timestamp fields.

3. **Required Fields**: We've made assumptions about which fields are required vs. optional based on typical usage patterns.

4. **Relationships**: We've inferred relationships between entities (e.g., User to Messages, Products to Orders) based on the app screens and flow.

## State Management

1. **Loading States**: We've assumed three primary loading states for all operations: loading, success, and error.

2. **Caching**: We've implemented basic in-memory caching for frequently accessed data to improve performance.

3. **Pagination**: We've assumed server-side pagination for list endpoints with a consistent format (page/limit parameters, hasMore flag in response).

4. **Error Handling**: We've implemented centralized error handling with user-friendly messages and retry capabilities.

## UI Integration

1. **Widget Hierarchy**: We've assumed the app follows a screen -> component -> widget hierarchy for UI elements.

2. **Theme**: We've assumed the app uses a consistent theme throughout with primary/accent colors for visual consistency.

3. **Responsive Design**: We've designed state management and UI feedback to work across different screen sizes.

## Backend Documentation Gaps

Since the backend documentation for Pusher events was incomplete, we've made these additional assumptions:

1. **Event Data Format**: We've assumed event data follows a structure similar to API responses for consistency.

2. **Private Channel Auth**: We've assumed the backend provides a channel authentication endpoint.

3. **Error Events**: We've implemented handling for potential error events that might be sent from the server.

4. **Connection Recovery**: We've implemented reconnection logic for Pusher to handle transient connection issues.

## Testing Environment

1. **Mock Services**: We've assumed the app should be testable without a real API or Pusher connection, hence the mock implementations.

2. **Error Simulation**: We've included utilities to simulate errors for testing error handling.

These assumptions can be adjusted as needed once more information becomes available about the backend implementation. The code has been structured to make these changes straightforward.
