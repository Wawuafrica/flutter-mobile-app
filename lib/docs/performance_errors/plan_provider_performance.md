# PlanProvider Performance Considerations

## Potential Issues:

*   **Heavy JSON Parsing on Main Thread:**
    *   In `fetchAllPlans()`, `generatePaymentLink()`, `handlePaymentCallback()`, and `fetchUserSubscriptionDetails()`, the synchronous parsing of API responses into `Plan`, `PaymentLink`, and `Subscription` objects (via `fromJson` calls) occurs on the main thread. If the API responses contain a large number of plans, complex plan/subscription data, or extensive details, this synchronous parsing can lead to UI unresponsiveness (jank) by blocking the UI thread.
    *   **Recommendation:** For potentially large or complex JSON payloads, offload the JSON decoding and object mapping to a separate isolate using `compute` from `package:flutter/foundation.dart`. This allows the heavy computational work to be performed on a separate thread, ensuring a smoother user interface.

*   **Blocking I/O in `handlePaymentCallback`:**
    *   Inside `handlePaymentCallback`, the line `await OnboardingStateService.saveStep('disclaimer');` involves writing data to persistent storage. Although `SharedPreferences` (a likely underlying storage mechanism) is generally fast, any disk I/O operation is inherently blocking and, if executed on the main thread, can introduce a slight delay.
    *   **Recommendation:** While the performance impact of this single save operation is likely minimal, it's a good general practice to perform any non-critical disk I/O operations asynchronously off the main thread, especially within critical user flows like payment processing. However, in most cases with `SharedPreferences`, this particular operation may not be a significant performance bottleneck.

## General Considerations:

*   **`notifyListeners()` Granularity:** The `setSuccess()` method, which calls `notifyListeners()`, is invoked after various successful operations (fetching data, generating a payment link, handling a payment callback, and selecting/clearing state). To prevent excessive widget rebuilds, ensure that widgets consuming the `PlanProvider`'s state are optimized to rebuild only when the specific data they depend on changes.
    *   **Recommendation:** Effectively utilize the `Selector` widget from the `provider` package to listen only to particular properties of the provider (`plans`, `selectedPlan`, `paymentLink`, `subscription`). This targeted listening ensures that only the necessary parts of the UI are updated when those specific properties change, minimizing unnecessary rendering work.
