# Onboarding Flow Performance Considerations

This document outlines performance considerations specific to the onboarding flow, which involves a series of steps that guide new users through the application's setup and configuration. It examines interactions between UI components, `OnboardingStateService`, `UserProvider`, and relevant API calls.

## Potential Issues and Recommendations:

*   **Sequential SharedPreferences Operations:** The onboarding flow typically involves saving user choices and progress at each step. The `OnboardingStateService` relies heavily on `SharedPreferences`, and the sequential nature of these storage operations can lead to UI delays. In addition, this process is performed synchronously.
    *   **Recommendation:** Batch the shared preference, or use asynchronous storage operations.

*   **Synchronous Operations in Onboarding UI:** Operations such as fetching user data, or doing a lot of navigation, can cause slow app startup.
    *   **Recommendation:** Create new threads for long and exhaustive operations.

*   **Loading of onboarding too late:** Displaying the onboarding flow may be delayed, thus creating jank for new users.
    *   **Recommendation:** Create an onboarding loading screen that quickly loads the bare necessities for users, this will lead to a more fluid flow for new users.

*   **Unnecessary `notifyListeners()` calls** The methods of the Onboarding flow probably does not need to use this.
    *   **Recommendation:** Remove them.

## Specific Code Locations to Review:

*   Any UI calls and methods within the onboarding process.
*   Any long and synchronous processes within the onboarding.

*   `lib/providers/user_provider.dart`
*    Any UI files related to this flow.
